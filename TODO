* Setup python-mysql on test VM host
* Check reference how to store blob in mysql




Here are some things on my to-do list, in no particular order:

 * Automatically switch to a larger block size to reduce the overhead for files
   that rarely change after being created (like >= 100MB video files :-)

 * Implement the fsync(datasync) API method?
   if datasync:
    only flush user data (file contents)
   else:
    flush user & meta data (file contents & attributes)

 * Implement rename() independently of link()/unlink() to improve performance?

 * Implement `--verify-reads` option that recalculates hashes when reading to
   check for data block corruption?

 * `report_disk_usage()` has become way too expensive for regular status
   reports because it takes more than a minute on a 7.0 GB database. The only
   way it might work was if the statistics are only retrieved from the database
   once and from then on kept up to date inside Python, but that seems like an
   awful lot of work. For now I've removed the call to `report_disk_usage()`
   from `print_stats()` and added a `--print-stats` command-line option that
   reports the disk usage and then exits.

 * Tag databases with a version number and implement automatic upgrades because
   I've grown tired of upgrading my database by hand :-)

 * Change the project name because `DedupFS` is already used by at least two
   other projects? One is a distributed file system which shouldn't cause too
   much confusion, but the other is a deduplicating file system as well :-\

 * Support directory hard links without upsetting FUSE and add a command-line
   option that instructs `dedupfs.py` to search for identical subdirectories
   and replace them with directory hard links.

 * Support files that don't fit in RAM (virtual machine disk imagesâ€¦)
